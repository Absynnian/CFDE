`Not Started` means nobody has posted or started work on that translation. `Incomplete` translations are missing large portions of dialogue or are outdated and are not included in the main download. `Complete` translations may have typos/bugs are that not present in the English version but are included in the main download.

If you want to translate CFDE into a language not listed (ex. Polish or Thai) send paradigmnomad a DM.
